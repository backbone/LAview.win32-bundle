    Operation Systems

 * GNU/Linux (Gentoo, Debian, etc.)
 * MS Windows (Windows 5.1 aka XP)
 * BSD-based (FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, Mac OS X)

If you need support of one more OS, be free in writing of patches and sending
pull-requests to the mainstream.


    Compilation
    -----------

    Compilation under GNU/Linux

$ mkdir build-gcc && cd build-gcc
$ cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr
$ make -j$((`getconf _NPROCESSORS_ONLN`+1))

    Compilation under MS Windows

$ mkdir build-mingw && cd build-mingw
$ cmake -G "MSYS Makefiles" .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
$ make -j$((NUMBER_OF_PROCESSORS + 1))

    Compilation under BSD-based Systems.

TODO: add description here.


    Packing/Installation
    --------------------

    Packing/Installation under GNU/Linux

$ cpack
Install using System Package Manager.

    Packing/Installation under MS Windows

$ cpack
Install using generated by NSIS executable.

    Packing/Installation under BSD-based

$ cpack
Install using System Package Manager.


    Testing
    -------

    Testing under GNU/Linux

$ ctest -j$((`getconf _NPROCESSORS_ONLN`+1))

Automated tests for memory leaks:
$ ctest -j$((NUMBER_OF_PROCESSORS + 1)) -D NightlyMemCheck && grep definitely Testing/Temporary/LastDynamicAnalysis_*.log

    Testing under MS Windows

$ ctest -j$((NUMBER_OF_PROCESSORS + 1))
Automated tests for memory leaks are not available as far as Valgrind not
present on this platform.

    Testing under BSD-based

$ ctest
Automated tests for memory leaks are not available as far as Valgrind not
present on this platform.
